# Learning a Bayesian Network from F1 data
The present work consists in a deliverable for the exam of __Fundamentals of AI and Knowledge
Representation (module 3)__ held by professor __Paolo Torroni__ as part of the Master Degree in Artificial
Intelligence (University of Bologna, Italy).

## Abstract
The aim of my project is to deploy a Bayesian network model for the analysis
of a dataset containing information about F1 races ranging from year 2007 to year 2020 (both included).
I exploited a Python library called __pgmpy__ as a tool to build a Bayesian Network which models
statistical dependencies between variables related to the realm of Formula One races. The network,
including both its structure (DAG) and its internal parameters (CPTs), is entirely learned from data
without the need of any prior knowledge about this particular domain.

## Content
The derivable consists both in a [Jupyter Notebook](./notebook.ipynb) and a [project report](./report.pdf).
